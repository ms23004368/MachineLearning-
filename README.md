Student Performance Prediction Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
This project applies both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict student performance based on their engagement with the course. Key engagement metrics include interaction with course materials and time spent on the platform. The models implemented offer valuable insights into different aspects of student behavior and performance, providing a comprehensive view for educators.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict student success or failure based on their engagement levels. By applying both supervised learning (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) and unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering and DBSCAN), we aim to provide insights into student behaviors, segment students by engagement, and detect at-risk students who may need special attention.

Algorithms Used
Supervised Learning:
Logistic Regression: A baseline classification algorithm used to predict whether a student will pass or fail. Accuracy: 83.93%.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy to 85.41% by identifying key engagement features (e.g., "mean sum click", "days logged").
Unsupervised Learning:
K-Means Clustering: Used to segment students into high, medium, and low engagement clusters based on their interactions.
DBSCAN: Used for outlier detection to find students with erratic or unusual engagement patterns.
Data
The project is based on student engagement data that includes:

Number of clicks on course materials
Time spent on the learning platform
Demographic information (age, gender, disability status, etc.)
Course results (pass/fail)
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/student-performance-prediction.git
cd student-performance-prediction
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts for model training and evaluation.

The script will:

Load the student engagement dataset.
Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict student performance.
Cluster students using K-Means and detect outliers with DBSCAN.
Generate visualizations such as feature importance and engagement cluster analysis.
The Q-learning reinforcement learning example simulates a student's learning journey to optimize actions based on rewards from the environment.

Results
Logistic Regression: Achieved 83.93% accuracy with balanced precision and recall.
Random Forest: Achieved 85.41% accuracy and provided detailed insights into the most important engagement features.
K-Means Clustering: Identified three main student groups (high, medium, and low engagement).
DBSCAN: Effectively detected outliers (students with irregular or minimal engagement), highlighting students at higher risk of underperformance.
Future Enhancements
Feature Engineering: Further refinement of engagement features to improve predictive performance.
Advanced Algorithms: Implementing deep learning models for improved accuracy.
Real-Time Monitoring: Creating a dashboard for real-time tracking of student engagement and risk assessment.
Personalized Interventions: Using insights from clustering and outlier detection to provide tailored support for students at risk
